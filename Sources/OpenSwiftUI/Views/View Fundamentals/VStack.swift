/// of the "lazy" version.
///
/// The following example shows a simple vertical stack of 10 text views:
///
///     var body: some View {
///         VStack(
///             alignment: .leading,
///             spacing: 10
///         ) {
///             ForEach(
///                 1...10,
///                 id: \.self
///             ) {
///                 Text("Item \($0)")
///             }
///         }
///     }
