/// A custom parameter attribute that constructs views from closures.
///
/// You typically use ``ViewBuilder`` as a parameter attribute for child
/// view-producing closure parameters, allowing those closures to provide
/// multiple child views. For example, the following `contextMenu` function
/// accepts a closure that produces one or more views via the view builder.
///
///     func contextMenu<MenuItems: View>(
///         @ViewBuilder menuItems: () -> MenuItems
///     ) -> some View
///
/// Clients of this function can use multiple-statement closures to provide
/// several child views, as shown in the following example:
///
///     myView.contextMenu {
///         Text("Cut")
///         Text("Copy")
///         Text("Paste")
///         if isSymbol {
///             Text("Jump to Definition")
///         }
///     }
///
