import Swift

/// A property wrapper that reads a value from a view's environment.
///
/// Use the `Environment` property wrapper to read a value
/// stored in a view's environment. Indicate the value to read using an
/// ``EnvironmentValues`` key path in the property declaration. For example, you
/// can create a property that reads the color scheme of the current
/// view using the key path of the ``EnvironmentValues/colorScheme``
/// property:
///
///     @Environment(\.colorScheme) var colorScheme: ColorScheme
///
/// You can condition a view's content on the associated value, which
/// you read from the declared property's ``wrappedValue``. As with any property
/// wrapper, you access the wrapped value by directly referring to the property:
///
///     if colorScheme == .dark { // Checks the wrapped value.
///         DarkContent()
///     } else {
///         LightContent()
///     }
///
/// If the value changes, OpenSwiftUI updates any parts of your view that depend on
/// the value. For example, that might happen in the above example if the user
/// changes the Appearance settings.
///
/// You can use this property wrapper to read --- but not set --- an environment
/// value. OpenSwiftUI updates some environment values automatically based on system
/// settings and provides reasonable defaults for others. You can override some
/// of these, as well as set custom environment values that you define,
/// using the ``View/environment(_:_:)`` view modifier.
///
/// For the complete list of environment values provided by OpenSwiftUI, see the
/// properties of the ``EnvironmentValues`` structure. For information about
/// creating custom environment values, see the ``EnvironmentKey`` protocol.
