import Swift

/// A part of an app's user interface with a life cycle managed by the
/// system.
///
/// You create an ``OpenSwiftUI/App`` by combining one or more instances
/// that conform to the `Scene` protocol in the app's
/// ``OpenSwiftUI/App/body-swift.property``. You can use the built-in scenes that
/// OpenSwiftUI provides, like ``OpenSwiftUI/WindowGroup``, along with custom scenes
/// that you compose from other scenes. To create a custom scene, declare a
/// type that conforms to the `Scene` protocol. Implement the required
/// ``OpenSwiftUI/Scene/body-swift.property`` computed property and provide the
/// content for your custom scene:
///
///     struct MyScene: Scene {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 MyRootView()
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// A scene acts as a container for a view hierarchy that you want to display
/// to the user. The system decides when and how to present the view hierarchy
/// in the user interface in a way that's platform-appropriate and dependent
/// on the current state of the app. For example, for the window group shown
/// above, the system lets the user create or remove windows that contain
/// `MyRootView` on platforms like macOS and iPadOS. On other platforms, the
/// same view hierarchy might consume the entire display when active.
///
/// Read the ``OpenSwiftUI/EnvironmentValues/scenePhase`` environment
/// value from within a scene or one of its views to check whether a scene is
/// active or in some other state. You can create a property that contains the
/// scene phase, which is one of the values in the ``OpenSwiftUI/ScenePhase``
/// enumeration, using the ``OpenSwiftUI/Environment`` attribute:
///
///     struct MyScene: Scene {
///         @Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase
///
///         // ...
///     }
///
/// The `Scene` protocol provides scene modifiers, defined as protocol methods
/// with default implementations, that you use to configure a scene. For
/// example, you can use the ``OpenSwiftUI/Scene/onChange(of:perform:)`` modifier to
/// trigger an action when a value changes. The following code empties a cache
/// when all of the scenes in the window group have moved to the background:
///
///     struct MyScene: Scene {
///         @Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase
///         @StateObject private var cache = DataCache()
///
///         var body: some Scene {
///             WindowGroup {
///                 MyRootView()
///             }
///             .onChange(of: scenePhase) { newScenePhase in
///                 if newScenePhase == .background {
///                     cache.empty()
///                 }
///             }
///         }
///     }
