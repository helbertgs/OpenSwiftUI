/// Key equivalents consist of a letter, punctuation, or function key that can

///
/// Key equivalents are used to establish keyboard shortcuts to app
/// functionality. Any key can be used as a key equivalent as long as pressing
/// it produces a single character value. Key equivalents are typically
/// initialized using a single-character string literal, with constants for
/// unprintable or hard-to-type values.
///
/// The modifier keys necessary to type a key equivalent are factored in to the
/// resulting keyboard shortcut. That is, a key equivalent whose raw value is
/// the capitalized string "A" corresponds with the keyboard shortcut
/// Command-Shift-A. The exact mapping may depend on the keyboard layoutâ€”for
/// example, a key equivalent with the character value "}" produces a shortcut
/// equivalent to Command-Shift-] on ANSI keyboards, but would produce a
/// different shortcut for keyboard layouts where punctuation characters are in
/// different locations.
